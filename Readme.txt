## 1. Introduction

CTwist is a language inspired by C++, but improving on everything associated
with the development process, from the language's syntax, library, build
process, etc. The build tools are heavily based on LLVM, which provides the
necessary infrastructure to immediately generate optimized native code for a
large number of platforms without much hassle. It is an intermediate layer that
is well-documented, stable, and widely applied.
